# Using the For Loop

With the help of Graphviz, I have been creating a number of family trees for use on a family history website. The following is a simple script which, using a `for loop`, dispenses with the tedium of individually converting each `.dot` file into an `.svg` graphic.

```bash
FOLDER=/home/$USER/folder/where/files/located

cd $FOLDER &&

for file in *.dot;
  do
    STEM=$(basename $file .dot)

    dot -Tsvg $file -o $STEM.svg
  done
```

The script will look for any files with the `.dot` suffix in the designated folder and `basename` will then strip the `.dot` suffix from any files it finds.

The final line is the command to convert the `.dot` files into the `.svg` format, and save the converted files with the same file name as the source, but with an `svg` suffix instead.
