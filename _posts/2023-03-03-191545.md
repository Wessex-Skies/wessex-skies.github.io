synopsis: How to insert the current date into a document when working in neovim
---

Easily insert the current date into a neovim file.

Add the following to `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`

```
" Insert current date
nnoremap <leader>d :put =strftime('%Y-%m-%d')<CR>
inoremap <leader>d <C-o>:put =strftime('%Y-%m-%d')<CR>
```

I have set the `leader` key to `\`, so tapping `\d` (backslash then d) will result in the date being added at whichever point the cursor is located.
