---

This post explains how to create an i3blocklet that will check if NordVPN is running.

To begin, the following will need to be added to `.config/i3blocks/config`.

```bash
# NordVPN status
#
[nordvpn]
command=~/bin/nordvpn_status.sh
label=NordVPN
color=#00FF00
separator=true
interval=10
```

Next we create the bash script, which is saved as `~/bin/nordvpn_status.sh`.

## Version 1

```bash

#!/bin/bash
#

# Used in conjunction with i3blocks
#

# The following query asks if the word 'Connected' apears in the output produced by the command 'nordvpn status' (q = don't show the output).
#
if nordvpn status | grep -q "Connected";

# If the word does appear (ie, we're connected),
#
then 

# The following line will produce the text that appears on the i3 bar. In this case, it will identify the country in which the server we are connected to is located
#
nordvpn status | grep Country # command

# If the word does not appear (ie, we're NOT connected)
#
else 

echo is DISCONNECTED # full text
echo is DISCONNECTED # short text
echo \#FF0000 # color

# End
fi

```

## Version 2

This script provides a visual warning if the VPN server to which you are connected is outside the United Kingdom, and a further warning if the connection goes down. You can of course change the locale to suit your own needs.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#

# Used in conjunction with i3blocks
#

# Is NordVPN connected?
#
if nordvpn status | grep -q "Connected";


# If NordVPN is connected
#
then

  STATUS=$(nordvpn status | grep Country | xargs echo)

  # Full & short text
  echo "$STATUS"
  echo "$STATUS"

  # Set text to red if the country status is not the UK
  [ "${STATUS}" != "Country: United Kingdom" ] && echo "#ff0000"

  exit 0

# If NordVPN is not connected
#
else

  # Full & short text
  echo "is DISCONNECTED"
  echo "is DOWN"

  # Exit with warning (white text on red background)
  exit 33

fi
```

## Restart i3

Once the scripts have ben saved, type `i3-msg restart` and a new entry should appear in your status bar.
