excerpt: How to send command output to the clipboard 
---

Sending the output of a command to the clipboard is quite straightforward, and involves piping the command to `xclip` as detailed in this example;

```bash
date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" | xclip -sel clip
```

Paste from the clipboard as normal and, in this case, the result was `2023-03-02 12:14`
