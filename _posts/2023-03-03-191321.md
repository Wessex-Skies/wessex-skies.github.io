synopsis: Replace spaces with dashes in filenames
---

Create a bash script to replace spaces with dashes in a string of text.

`CD` to the directory that contains the files, and run this script;

```bash
for f in *\ *; do mv "$f" "${f// /_}"; done
```

If for whatever reason you wanted to replace the dashes with spaces, you would use this command;

```bash
for f in *_*; do mv "$f" "${f//_/ }"; done
```
