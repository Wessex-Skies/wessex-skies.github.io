# Synchronizing With Unison

Set up bi-directional file synchronization with unison.

## Install Unison on Ubuntu 

```bash
sudo apt install unison  
```

## Create a Configuration File 

Create the file `~/.unison/config.prf`. The file name does not have to be `config`, it can be anything you like. Within that file add the following; 

```bash 
# Unison preferences

# Description
label = Sync Documents

# Directories to be synchronized 
root = /home/$USER/directory1
root = /home/$USER/directory2

# Run without prompts
auto=true
batch=true

# Items to ignore
ignore = Name {.Trash-1000}
```

1. Change `/directory1/` and `/directory2/` to match your needs.
2. The `label` is a simple description.  
3. To allow unison to run without user interaction (for example, when running a cron job), set `auto` and `batch` to true. 

## Running 

To synchronize the directories, run the command (where `config.prf` is the configuration file set up a few moments ago);  

```bash 
unison config.prf 
```
