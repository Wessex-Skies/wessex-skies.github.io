excerpt: How to merge several PDF's into one document.
---

To convert several PDF's into one PDF document, we use `pdfunite`. This is a part of `poppler-utils`, which can be installed using the following command;

```bash
sudo apt install poppler-utils
```

To merge the documents, run the following. 

```bash
pdfunite 1.pdf 2.pdf 3.pdf output.pdf
```
